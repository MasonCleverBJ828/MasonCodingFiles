This is the Rock-Paper-Scissors (Python) project I made myself.

If youâ€™ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.
